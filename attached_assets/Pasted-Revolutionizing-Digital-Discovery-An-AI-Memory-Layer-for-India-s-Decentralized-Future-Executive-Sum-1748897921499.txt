Revolutionizing Digital Discovery: An AI Memory Layer for India's Decentralized Future
Executive Summary: LAYRD – Unlocking Personalized Discovery in Decentralized India
LAYRD represents a groundbreaking advancement in digital interaction, introducing an AI memory layer engineered to fundamentally transform buyer-seller discovery. Its core innovation lies in its capacity to proactively learn and unify fragmented user context across diverse digital domains, moving beyond the inherent limitations of conventional aggregators. This foundational shift aims to cultivate a more relevant, efficient, and user-centric digital experience. 1
A pivotal aspect of LAYRD's strategy is its deep integration with India's burgeoning digital public infrastructure. The platform is purpose-built for Open Networks (ONDC) and leverages secure standards such as ABHA (Ayushman Bharat Health Account). This strategic alignment positions LAYRD at the vanguard of India's decentralized digital economy, enabling direct buyer-seller connections and facilitating secure, user-controlled data exchange. This architectural choice is particularly significant within the highly sensitive healthcare sector, where data privacy and interoperability are paramount. 1
LAYRD's immediate go-to-market strategy is sharply focused on the healthcare sector, addressing critical pain points for both patients and medical professionals. The platform offers AI-powered conversational medical history taking, automated scribing, and seamless pharmacy linking via ONDC. This concentrated entry capitalizes on the stable nature of health data for robust personalization, providing a clear pathway to market validation. The company harbors ambitious plans for rapid expansion into other ONDC-enabled verticals, including food and retail, demonstrating a clear growth trajectory. 1
For investors, LAYRD presents a unique opportunity to support a deep technology AI solution that tackles a fundamental market inefficiency: the broken discovery paradigm. The platform's commitment to a privacy-by-design, user-centric approach further enhances its appeal. Its strategic alignment with India's rapidly expanding digital public infrastructure, coupled with a strong founding team possessing profound expertise in both AI and healthcare, significantly mitigates investment risk, positioning LAYRD for substantial scale and societal impact. 1
The strategic positioning of LAYRD goes beyond merely solving a specific business problem; it is poised to capitalize on a significant macro trend: the global movement away from centralized, ad-revenue-driven digital platforms. The rise and expansion of decentralized protocols like ONDC in India signify a broader market demand for more transparent, user-centric, and efficient discovery mechanisms. LAYRD's AI memory layer directly counters the inherent algorithmic bias and misaligned incentives that often characterize traditional aggregators. This indicates a long-term, structural opportunity, suggesting LAYRD is not just addressing a transient market niche but is a potential foundational player in a re-architected digital marketplace. 1
LAYRD's singular focus on integrating with ONDC and ABHA uniquely positions it to harness India's rapidly evolving digital public infrastructure. Success in India could establish a replicable blueprint for other emerging markets or regions exploring similar decentralized ecosystems. This provides LAYRD with a substantial first-mover advantage and a proven operational model for future global expansion, aligning with its multi-phase growth strategy. 1
Furthermore, LAYRD's initial strategic entry into healthcare is a particularly astute move. Health data is inherently stable, deeply personal, and crucial for individual well-being, creating a high motivation for users to adopt and maintain a unified, private "memory layer." This establishes a strong, sticky user base and a robust, high-quality data foundation for the AI, which can then be extended to other, potentially less sensitive, consumer domains with greater ease. This approach minimizes initial data volatility and maximizes user retention, building a durable competitive advantage. 1
LAYRD's Disruptive Vision: AI Memory, Decentralization, and Healthcare Transformation
The Aggregator Problem and LAYRD's Solution
The contemporary digital landscape is characterized by a pervasive "buyer-seller discovery crisis." This crisis stems from sellers' over-reliance on centralized aggregators, which often compel them into advertising models that erode their margins and diminish their control over branding and customer relationships. Simultaneously, buyers encounter significant friction, navigating through sponsored results, often irrelevant recommendations, and experiencing "filter fatigue" due to an overwhelming array of choices. This system is fundamentally misaligned, prioritizing the aggregator's ad revenue over genuine user value and relevance, leading to inherent algorithmic bias. 1
LAYRD directly confronts this systemic issue by championing personalization and decentralized platforms. At its core, LAYRD functions as an "AI memory layer" that dynamically injects context based on individual user needs. This innovative approach enables direct, efficient connections with decentralized sellers across diverse domains, including healthcare, travel, and retail, effectively bypassing the traditional aggregator bottleneck. 1
Deep Dive into LAYRD's AI Memory Layer and Personalization Capabilities
LAYRD's AI is engineered to achieve a profound understanding of its users by consolidating fragmented contextual information. It gathers data scattered across various applications, platforms, and devices, integrating them into a "UNIFIED CONTEXT LAYER." This unified layer empowers the AI to proactively learn and adapt to user preferences across different domains and interactions, thereby building a rich, evolving user profile. 1
To deliver hyper-relevant suggestions, LAYRD employs a sophisticated knowledge graph that intelligently combines both structured data, such as purchase history or demographic information, and unstructured data, including nuances from voice conversations or text inputs. This deep understanding facilitates natural, "voice-first interaction," rendering the platform more accessible and intuitive than traditional user interfaces. Crucially, LAYRD supports "End-to-End Task Completion," meaning it not only provides recommendations but also assists users in seamlessly executing actions like booking, ordering, or other services. 1
A foundational principle of LAYRD's AI memory layer is its steadfast commitment to user data control and privacy. In stark contrast to traditional aggregators that often treat user data as a proprietary asset for their own benefit, such as for ad targeting, LAYRD ensures that the user retains full ownership and control over their data, including any AI-generated insights. The platform prioritizes aggregate learning for personalization while actively minimizing the retention of raw data. Its AI is designed to optimize for the user's best interest—be it health, value, or efficiency—rather than solely for platform revenue. This is achieved through radical transparency and a requirement for granular, ongoing informed consent. 1
The combination of LAYRD's AI memory layer, its privacy-by-design philosophy, and its integration with ONDC and ABHA establishes a robust and distinctive competitive advantage. By empowering users to own and control their data and by providing a unified, contextually rich data layer, LAYRD can cultivate a deeper, more accurate data asset than traditional aggregators who often silo user information. This superior data quality and the trust it engenders, in turn, drive enhanced personalization, which attracts more users, thereby creating a powerful, self-reinforcing network effect. The ABHA integration, specifically, ensures that sensitive health data is interoperable and securely managed, a critical advantage in a highly regulated sector. This positions LAYRD to aggregate and leverage data in a manner that is both powerful for personalization and compliant with user expectations and regulatory frameworks. This creates a unique data asset that is both deep (contextual) and broad (across domains), making it increasingly challenging for competitors to replicate as more users join and contribute to the collective intelligence of the memory layer. 1
Leveraging ONDC and ABHA for a Decentralized Ecosystem
LAYRD's architectural foundation is explicitly designed to operate within India's Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). This strategic choice enables LAYRD to facilitate direct connections between buyers and sellers, effectively eliminating the need for a single, centralized intermediary. This aligns with the broader national vision of democratizing digital commerce and fostering a more equitable digital economy. 1 The ONDC ecosystem is projected to significantly enhance the integration of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) into India's digital economy, offering them expanded reach and growth opportunities by democratizing access to a national stage. Furthermore, AI-driven innovations within ONDC are expected to enhance search functionalities and optimize logistics, creating a more efficient marketplace for all participants. 2 This integration signifies LAYRD's alignment with a major government-backed initiative for digital public infrastructure, providing a fertile and large-scale proving ground for its decentralized AI memory layer.
Within the healthcare domain, LAYRD leverages the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) standards. This integration ensures secure and interoperable health data management, allowing a patient's unified health memory to be securely accessible across various healthcare providers with explicit user consent. This directly addresses the pervasive issue of fragmented medical records and significantly improves the continuity and quality of care. 1 LAYRD's commitment to these national digital health initiatives underscores its long-term viability and potential for widespread adoption.
Strategic Entry: The Healthcare Opportunity and Pilot Success
LAYRD strategically targets significant, well-documented problems for both patients and doctors within the healthcare system. For patients, it alleviates the burden of long wait times, fragmented paper-based records, repetitive history-taking, difficulty understanding complex medical information, and a general lack of reliable follow-up. 1 For doctors, it drastically reduces administrative burden, mitigates the risk of poor decision-making due to incomplete data, standardizes documentation through intelligent AI scribing, and enhances patient follow-up and compliance. 1
LAYRD's innovative approach in healthcare includes multilingual voice-powered intake, allowing patients to report symptoms naturally in any Indian language. Its automated scribing feature transcribes consultations, structuring information for easy retrieval and better long-term care management. Crucially, its "Ecosystem Connectivity" leverages ONDC (Beckn) to link consultations directly with pharmacy services, enabling end-to-end care from diagnosis to medication fulfillment. 1 These specific applications, such as AI scribing and conversational intake, are prime examples of the "Services as Software" trend, where AI automates and significantly enhances traditional service delivery. This approach aligns directly with the investment interest in "Services as Software firms" and "vertical AI" within the venture capital landscape, as the healthcare domain provides the necessary specificity and high-value use cases for this vertical AI to thrive, demonstrate clear return on investment, and achieve significant operational efficiencies. 3
LAYRD has already initiated a pilot program in a large tertiary care hospital in Gujarat. This pilot is projected to reach approximately 20,000 patients within the initial three-month period, serving to validate the critical need for and usability of the platform. The strategic plan includes leveraging existing distribution networks to onboard numerous hospitals and clinics across Gujarat and Delhi NCR, with an ambitious target of reaching approximately 800,000 users within one year. 1 This early market validation provides concrete evidence of product-market fit and scalability.
The Team and Future Growth Trajectory
LAYRD is spearheaded by a highly complementary founding team. Tejasvi Chebrolu (CEO) is an applied AI researcher with a BTech in CS and an MS in Computational Linguistics from IIITH, bringing a broad domain perspective and the ambition to identify commonalities across various domains. Tattvam Nair (COO), an MBBS Gold Medalist from JIPMER, provides profound understanding and fresh perspectives essential for impacting the healthcare industry, embodying a resilient ethos for navigating complex challenges. Abhijit Manatkar (CTO), an AI researcher from IBM Research with a BTech in CS from IIITH, ensures the development of ethical technology that benefits everyone. This unique blend of deep AI expertise, medical insight, and operational acumen is critical for realizing LAYRD's ambitious vision. 1
LAYRD has a well-defined, multi-phase strategic roadmap for growth. Phase 1 (Years 0-3) focuses on proving the cross-domain model in India by scaling the healthcare pilot and launching a second vertical, such as food or retail, via ONDC. Phase 2 (Years 3-5) aims to consolidate leadership in India and initiate initial international pilots in markets with similar open protocol ecosystems. Phase 3 (Years 5-8+) involves targeted global expansion, platform maturation, and diversification of revenue streams, including potential B2B/licensing models for its core AI engine. The ultimate vision is to achieve ubiquity, becoming the central, personalized AI interaction layer for daily digital life, extending beyond commerce to smart home and productivity applications. 1
The company's internal framing of its mission, "Can we reimagine buyer-seller discovery the same way Perplexity reimagined search?" 1, serves as a powerful and concise articulation of its ambition. Perplexity successfully transformed how users interact with search by providing synthesized, direct answers and conversational interaction, rather than merely a list of links. By drawing this parallel, LAYRD positions itself as a company aiming for a similar paradigm shift, not just an incremental improvement, in the realm of digital discovery. This immediately conveys the ambition and potential for a fundamental change in user behavior and market dynamics, indicating LAYRD's aim to be a category creator.

This direct application of AI in healthcare, improving efficiency and patient outcomes, aligns perfectly with SenseAI's stated industry focus. 1
Furthermore, LAYRD is built for India's Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) and leverages ABHA standards, ensuring secure, user-controlled data exchange and seamless ecosystem connectivity, especially for pharmacy services. This commitment to privacy-by-design and integration with national digital infrastructure provides a robust framework for scaling our healthcare solution. 1
We have already launched a pilot program in a large tertiary care hospital in Gujarat, expecting to reach 20,000 patients in the initial three months. This early validation demonstrates the tangible impact and usability of our platform. 1
We believe LAYRD's advanced AI memory layer and its immediate, impactful application in healthcare make it an ideal fit for SenseAI's portfolio. We would be grateful for the opportunity to present our full vision and discuss how we can turn this technology into a successful venture together.
Sincerely,

Conclusions
LAYRD presents a compelling investment opportunity rooted in a profound understanding of current digital market inefficiencies and a forward-looking embrace of India's digital public infrastructure. The core innovation, an AI memory layer, offers a transformative solution to the "aggregator's dilemma," moving from revenue-centric models to truly user-centric, personalized discovery. This fundamental re-architecture of digital interactions holds the potential for long-term, structural impact across various sectors.
The strategic decision to enter the healthcare market first is particularly astute. Health data provides a stable, high-value foundation for building a robust and sticky AI memory layer, which can then be leveraged for expansion into other consumer domains. This approach not only addresses critical pain points for patients and doctors but also aligns with the "Services as Software" trend, demonstrating clear operational efficiencies and return on investment.
LAYRD's deep integration with ONDC and ABHA is not merely a feature; it is a strategic positioning that allows the company to capitalize on India's unique decentralized digital ecosystem. This provides a large-scale proving ground for a model that could eventually be replicated globally, establishing LAYRD as a pioneer in the next wave of digital commerce and services. The complementary expertise of the founding team in AI and healthcare further strengthens the venture's execution capabilities.
The identified VCs and angel investors, including Mukesh Bansal, Pi Ventures, SenseAI Ventures, Blume Ventures, Accel India, Matrix Partners India, Kalaari Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, 3one4 Capital, Endiya Partners, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightbox Ventures, Orios Venture Partners, Kunal Shah, Binny Bansal, Rajan Anandan, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Anand Chandrasekaran, Rajesh Sawhney, Ramakant Sharma, Anupam Mittal, Sanjay Mehta, Jitendra Gupta, and Gokul Rajaram, represent strategic capital that aligns with LAYRD's vision.
